pi_day_discussion_body = "Hi everyone! I'm excited for Pi Day next month. I was thinking about creating a contest to see who can come up with the most creative and unique way to represent the number pi. It could be a drawing, a poem, a song, or anything else you can think of. 🎉 The winner will receive a prize, so get creative and let's have some fun! 🤗 If you have any ideas or want to join in, just leave a comment below. Can't wait to see what everyone comes up with!\n\nAlso, and as a way to celebrate, we will be giving away 5 t-shirts! You only have to leave a comment of the format `🟢 271303656225123`, where the number will be your unique identifier. We will reduce all numbers to modulo $10^\{14\}\pi$ so think about that when choosing a number 🧠\n\nGood luck!"
